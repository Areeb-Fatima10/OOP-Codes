Overview

This project is a console-based Smart Home Management System implemented in Java using core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.
It simulates a real smart home where rooms contain multiple devices that can be turned on or off individually or all at once.

The system demonstrates how objects interact inside a real-world model using classes such as Device, Room, and Home.

Features

Add multiple rooms to a home

Add multiple devices to each room

Turn all devices on in a room

Turn all devices off in a room

Display detailed information about all rooms and devices

Perform home-level operations:

Activate the entire home (turn on all devices)

Shut down the entire home (turn off all devices)

OOP Concepts Used
Encapsulation

Each device has its own internal state (name, type, and on/off status) and exposes actions through methods.

Abstraction

Users interact with high-level methods such as:

turnAllDevicesOn()

turnAllDevicesOff()

showAllRoomsAndDevices()

Static Members

The Room.roomcount static variable tracks the total number of rooms created.

Object Interaction

A Home object contains multiple Room objects.

A Room object contains multiple Device objects.

Project Structure

└── public class SmartHomeApp (main method)

How It Works
1. Create a Home
Home h1 = new Home("Areeb's Smart Home", 2);

2. Create Rooms
Room r1 = new Room("Living Room", 4);
Room r2 = new Room("Bedroom", 4);

3. Add Rooms to Home
h1.addRoom(r1);
h1.addRoom(r2);

4. Create and Add Devices
Device d1 = new Device("Led bulb","Haier");
r1.addDevice(d1);

5. Display All Rooms and Devices
h1.showAllRoomsAndDevices();

6. Turn All Devices On or Off
h1.activateHome();     // Turns all devices on
h1.shutdownHome();     // Turns all devices off

How to Run

Copy all classes into a file named SmartHomeApp.java.

Compile the program:

javac SmartHomeApp.java


Run the program:

java SmartHomeApp

Possible Future Improvements

Add separate subclasses for device types (Light, Fan, AC, etc.)

Add a user menu for interactive control

Save device states using file handling

Implement automation or scheduling features
